# Featured-Developer-Proposal
<ol>
<li> We propose to create the application using Vue on the front end. As Vue enables developers to use ordinary HTML for front-end development rather than writing sophisticated JS code. In addition, the framework may generate reusable parts from view data. The ability to create custom elements improves code reuse and accelerates development.</li>
<li> We intend to use Java/Spring Boot as the backendÂ because it facilitates the development of rapid app solutions.</li>
